# Project Title ✨

## Description 📜

This is a simple project designed for practice in Python. The goal was to practice and learn the basics of using the MongoDB library. It operates in the console without a graphical user interface (GUI) and is not particularly remarkable. However, there is a small chance that I will expand and improve this project in the future to publish an application with an attractive UI in .exe format and integrated features. 🚀

## Libraries Used 📚

- **sys** - Built-in Python library
- **pymongo** - Version 4.7.3
